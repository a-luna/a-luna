**June 30 2020** &mdash; Introduction If you DuckDuckGo or bing! the phrase &ldquo;add search to static site&rdquo;, you will find hundreds of articles explaining how a client-side search product like Lunr.js can be integrated with Hugo, Eleventy or Gatsby. Given this fact, I feel compelled to explain why I created this blog post when it appears that this question has been sufficiently answered.
I decided to document my Hugo/Lunr.js solution because unlike other guides I found while researching this subject, my implementation:

**February 27 2020** &mdash; Decorators can be a daunting topic when first encountered. While the Zen of Python states &ldquo;There should be one&ndash; and preferably only one &ndash;obvious way to do it&rdquo;, there are many, equally valid ways to implement the same decorator. These different methods can be categorized as either function-based, class-based, or a hybrid of both. In this post I will explain the design and behavior of Python decorators and provide examples of decorators that I frequently use in my own code.

**November 13 2019** &mdash; Hugo includes a built-in syntax-highlighter called Chroma. Chroma is extremely fast since it is written in pure Go (like Hugo) and supports every language I can think of. Chroma&rsquo;s speed is especially important since syntax highlighters are notorious for causing slow page loads. However, it lacks one vital feature â€” an easy way to copy a code block to the clipboard. I decided to document my implementation using only vanilla JS since every blog post I found for this issue relied on jquery to parse the DOM, which is completely unnecessary at this point.
